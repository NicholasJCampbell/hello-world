# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I live in Louisville and work as a banker, but I recently completely a PhD in Hebrew Bible and the ancient Near East... I am hoping to transition from academics to data science.
I did it once but I just want to double check that I know what I am doing. Better to over-prepare than under-prepare!
